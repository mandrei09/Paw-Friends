  Looking for a place to post your lovely cats 😻, to find a solution for your cat's problem🩹, or just laugh at others 😹? Then **Paw Friends** is the perfect place for you!

🐾**Paw Friends**🐾 project is a open-discussion platform (Reddit-like site) made with **ASP.NET** Entity Framework .

  If you just want to see what others have posted, **you can still acces the platform without an account** 🗸, but you **won't be able to post** unless you join us. (✨what we would encourage you to do!✨)

The platform has a family friendly look, wanting to gather cat lovers from all over❤️.
